Feur Shadow Elytra (Repainted, Embedded)
=======================================
- Real Elytra item: feur_shadow_elytra:feur_wings_elytra
- Embedded **repainted 64x32** textures mapped to: [Wing001]..[Wing020]
- Optional direct filename: [Wing:wing014.png] (looks under feur_shadow_elytra:textures/elytra/)
- Two-way conversion recipes included.

Build
-----
./gradlew build  -> build/libs/feur_shadow_elytra-1.1.0.jar

Notes
-----
- This variant does **not** depend on Feur textures at runtime; it ships repainted versions sized for Elytra UV.
- If redistribution is a concern for your pack, keep this addon private to your server/modpack.
